<h2> 👨🏻‍💻 &nbsp;Problem Statement </h2>

<h3>👨🏻‍💻 &nbsp;Mission</h3>

Rainbow Foundation India is a PAN India non-profit organization registered under the Societies Registration Act, collaborting with diverse partners in 10 cities across India.
Rainbow Homes provides comprehensive care to children who have faced extreme vulnerabilities, who were/are abandoned, have run away from violent and abusive situations, have grown up in violence, are victims of sexual, physical, and mental abuse, and are children of sex workers and manual scavengers in rural and urban areas. Rainbow Homes rescues these children from a life of uncertainty, helplessness, and impending criminalization through its Residential Care and Community Based Care (CBC). Rainbow Homes Program aims to enable these children to live a dignified & independent life with a job, housing, and social capital with the support of Rainbow Future Program.

<h3>👨🏻‍💻 &nbsp;Context</h3>
● Rainbow Future Program (aftercare) is one of its kind Youth Leadership, Care and Development
program aimed at preparing the children moving on from Rainbow Homes Residential Care and
Community Based Care (CBC) to RHP(Rainbow Homes Program) Aftercare for self-reliant and
sustainable living to lead a meaningful, independent mainstreamed life as responsible and socially
contributing citizen of the country. Futures Program starts preparing older children at the age of 15
years and supports them till 23 or sometimes beyond 23.
</hr>

&nbsp;● Once Young Adults got settled (beyond the age of 23 years), the RHP(Rainbow Homes Program)
becomes a member of the more prominent family by facilitating them to organize into alum groups;
creates/provides platforms, and forums to assist alums in organizing themselves, planning, and
leading impactful activities in their life.
<h3> 👨🏻‍💻 &nbsp;Challenges</h3>
● The goal is to create an easily accessible, effective, and unbiased communication system that can reach different levels of the cohort in times of need and vis a versa.
</hr>

&nbsp;● Additionally, Rainbow Foundation aim to use the system to track the progress, employment status, well-being (physical, health, and emotional), and other needs of the entire cohort.

<h3> 👨🏻‍💻 &nbsp;Additional Considerations</h3>
● Solution should having better organised information to improve the effectiveness and quality of interventions
Solution should focus on providing effective connectivity and creating the next level of safety net: peer support network.

&nbsp;● Creating engagement opportunities to track their cohort, periodically assess and continuously support their alum.

<h1>Solution</h1>
Our team has developed a comprehensive website that addresses the need for efficient tracking and support for young adults. The website serves as a centralized platform where essential information, such as the young adult's name, Aadhaar number, email, and phone number, can be securely stored and easily accessed by authorized caretakers.


One key feature of our website is the integrated chat functionality, which enables caretakers to communicate directly with the young adult. This allows for a real-time understanding of the young adult's situation and ensures effective support and guidance. The chat feature promotes open and confidential communication, fostering a trusting relationship between the caretaker and the young adult.

Additionally, our website incorporates an SOS feature that provides immediate assistance to young adults in times of need. Whether they require health support, financial assistance, educational guidance, or any other form of support, they can easily activate the SOS feature, which will promptly connect them with the appropriate resources. This ensures that young adults receive timely and relevant support, enhancing their overall well-being.

To further enhance the effectiveness of our solution, we have implemented robust security measures to safeguard the sensitive data of young adults. Our website adheres to strict privacy protocols and incorporates encryption techniques to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the information stored.

In summary, our website offers a comprehensive solution to address the tracking and support needs of young adults. By providing a platform for caretakers to engage in direct communication and offering an SOS feature for immediate assistance, we aim to empower young adults and promote their well-being. Our focus on security ensures the privacy of their personal information, creating a safe and trusted environment for all users.
